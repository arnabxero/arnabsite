			<h3>Automatic Smart Water Pump Controller</h3>
			<img src="img/project1.jpg">
			<p>The Goal of this project was to control the water pump we use in houses 
			and factories to fill the water tanks. On 2019, I went to my village house 
			where my mother lives. I have seen her sitting in front of the water pump 
			switch to turn off it when the tank gets filled, so that the water is not 
			wasted. From that scene I have got the idea of making such a project. </p>

			<h3>Advanced Line Follower Robot with AI</h3>
			<img src="img/project3.jpg">
			<p>This is the successor of my previous Line Follower Robot I made for ICT Fest 
			2019. But now this one is very advanced and has a little bit AI, so that Whenever 
			it losts the track, it assumes where the track is and returns to the track. This track 
			finding algorithm works 99.9% of the time and returns the LFR to right track. </p>
